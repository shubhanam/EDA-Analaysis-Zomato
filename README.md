**Introduction :**
This data is about the Zomato (a food service company) situation at Banglore city. Zomato is the one of the best food service company in india. Many people are always do online order food and table book of restuarants from Zomato app or Zomato website. People are crazy about food at Banglore city , their demands of order online food increasing day by day. This data is all about the Zomato. for know more..


This data is downloaded from one of the famous and best website for data , kaggle.com .Kaggle allows users to find and publish data sets, explore and build models in a web-based data-science environment, work with other data scientists and machine learning engineers, and enter competitions to solve data science challenges.

This Data is .csv format downloaded from here : raw data link . This raw data has 17 columns and 51717 columns. We are analysing this data and visulization this data by using Python Programming . In python programming we use some library :

`Pandas` : Pandas is an open source Python package that is most widely used for data science/data analysis and machine learning tasks. Pandas makes it simple to do many of the time consuming, repetitive tasks associated with working with data, including: Data cleansing,Data fill,Data normalization,Merges and joins,Data visualization,Statistical analysis,Data inspection,Loading and saving data And much more.

`Numpy` : NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays. It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices. NumPy is a Python library and is written partially in Python, but most of the parts that require fast computation are written in C or C++.

`Matplotlib` : Matplotlib is a low level graph plotting library in python that serves as a visualization utility.

`Seaborn` : Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

**Data Preparation and Cleaning :**
Data preparation and Cleaning is the most important part of the EDA analysis and Visulization. There are lots of dust in data available like : Duplicate data, Null values, Unwanted data which is not requrement for analysis, unwanted columns, irreted symbols or any other format data under columns, and much more.

As data anlyst this is our reponsibility to clean the data before the analysis and get the results. if we don’t do this before analysis than we will stuck again and again and we can’t get the proper result.

In this dataset we cleaned some few data like :

- Drop unwanted columns.
- Drop duplicates .
- Handle null values .
- Remove unwanted symbols and make clean.
- Handle big value counts of data.

**Data Visualization :**
Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data. By using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data. Python provides various libraries that come with different features for visualizing data. know more

All these libraries come with different features and can support various types of graphs. In this tutorial, we will be discussing four such libraries.

- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
